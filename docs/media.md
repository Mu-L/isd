??? note "Referencing `isd` in the media"

    If you are writing about the `isd` project, plase make sure
    to use _lower-case_ letters (`isd` and _not_ `ISD`).
    `isd` stands for `interactive systemd` and since `systemd`
    is [written in lower-case](https://brand.systemd.io/)
    it makes sense to also write `isd` in lower-case.

    The prononciation are the literal letters `i-s-d` (_eye-es-de_).

    Thank you for reading this and respecting my wishes! üôè
